# product-backlog
Purpose: All new features, bugs, customer requests will be curated in this repo. We will use the issues created here to flesh out features, designs, and requirements. 

*What happens here, doesn't stay here*
- The issues reported in this repo will be worked on in other Hypothesis repos. 
- Issues created in #product-backlog will serve as parent cards that track all information about that request. 
- All Google docs, pr info, or issues created in other repos must be linked back to issues created in this repo. 
- We're implementing this system so that we can have complete transparency around our product developement process.

## Reporting Bugs
Classify bugs using ***Priority and Severity*** 

*Priority* 
-----
The importance and urgency of resolving the error. 

The importance can be defined by 
1) Paid vs. unpaid user 
2) High profile user (yes, this can impact the rating, but the severity of the bug will be taken into account as well)
3) Is currently affecting active development
4) Is affecting a goal that is prioritized on the product roadmap

- P1: Immediate. Has to be fixed immediately within 24 hours.
- P2: High. This bug should be resolved as soon as possible in the normal course of development activity.
- P3: Medium. This bug should be repaired after serious bugs have been fixed.
- P4: Low. It can be resolved in a future major system revision or not be resolved at all.

*Severity*
------
The degree of the error impact on the operation of the system.

- S1: Critical. The defect affects critical functionality or critical data. It does not have a workaround.
- S2: High. The defect affects major functionality or major data. It has a workaround but is not obvious and is difficult. 
- S3: Medium. The defect affects minor functionality or non-critical data. It has an easy workaround.  
- S4: Low. The defect does not affect functionality or data. It does not even need a workaround. It does not impact productivity or efficiency. It is merely an inconvenience.

*Bug reports*
----
_Each report will include (will be in the issue template):_
- Priority Measurement (Assign a label)
- Severity Measurement (Assign a label)
- Problem User is reporting
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected Behavior
- System Info (H client version, browser version)

## New Feature Request
Yay! New feature ideas are awesome! But before we start seriously thinking about them as a team, make sure you're providing as much detail in your card as possible. 

For Example: "I think a blue button would be cool" IS NOT A FEATURE REQUEST. 

Use the New Feature request form in the Issue Template to create a new feature request. Fill out all the fields, and you're golden. Thanks!
